prediction of soil contamination using Machine learning alogorithm
OBJECTIVE: 
To create a prediction model of maximum accuracy to predict the soil contamination of a given sample of soil.

PROPOSED SYSTEM :
Environmental pollution is being the burning challenge of current living organisms on the Earth. 

Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into an environment, and undesirable change in air, water and soil which affect human life. 

We propose a model to classify the soil contamination based on PH Level, calcium content, Phosphorus content and sand value.

By using Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) in Machine learning we achieve our target.

PROJECT MODULES:
Module 1:  Dataset collection 
Module 2:  Pre-Processing and EDA
Module 3:  Model Fitting
Module 4:  Accuracy Score (Evaluation)

MODULE -1 : DATASET COLLECTION 
Kaggle, a subsidiary of Google LLC, is an online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners. 
Kaggle allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models in a web-based data-science environment, work with other data scientists and machine learning engineers, and enter competitions to solve data science challenges.

MODULE – 2: EDA
EDA can be expanded as Exploratory Data Analysis.
Exploratory Data analysis (EDA) is used for visualize the datasets 
To visualize the dataset like pie chart, bar chart, box plot, histogram graph etc., to obtain deeper insights into the data and its properties.

MODULE – 3: MODEL FITTING
In this proposed system we are using two main machine learning   algorithms named as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and naïve Bayes algorithms. 
We can train the system using these two algorithms and evaluate training score calculated. 
To classify the soil type – Contaminated or not

MODULE – 4: EVALUATION
The system will predict the soil type with 98% accuracy
To evaluate the accuracy score using confusion matrix method
A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or "classifier") on a set of test data for which the true values are known.

CONCLUSION :
From the analysis of the data with respect to classification, it can be stated with high confidence that the soil contamination is a prevalent problem. This contamination is characterized by especially high concentrations of Sodium, phosphorous and PH level. The dataset was analyzed and worked upon. Classification of soil sample contamination is one that is constantly undergoing change. Most available data uses hierarchical classification to determine clusters of samples, along with principal component analysis. SVM and Naïve Bayes were used to collectively predict the contamination of the soil yielding desirable results with maximum accuracy.
